#+title: ORG ScratchPad

This is my scratchpad to help me remember how to do some things in org mode.
Org is simple, or so they say. 
It is just text! Just start typing.

* THIS IS A HEADING - LIKE (H1)
- It starts with one or more stars
- A heading has one star, a sub-heading two, etc.
* LEVEL 1
** Level 2
*** Level 3
**** Level 4
***** Level 5
****** Level 6
******* Level 7
******** Level 8
* MOVING AROUND IN OUR OUTLINE
- use ALT + <arrows>
* SAMPLE - LORD OF THE RINGS
** *Important* actors in this film are:
- Elijah Wood : He plays Frodo
- Sean Austin : He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember him well from his role as Mikey Walsh in /The Goonies/.
- others
** My favorite scenes are (in this order)
1. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
   - I really like Miranda Otto.
   - this was already my favorite scene in the book
2. The attack of the Rohirrim
3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
   - on DVD only
   - He makes a really funny face when it happens.
/In the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole./
* TEXT FORMATTING
- You can make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =code= and ~verbatim~, and, if you must, +strike-through+.
- Put these characters before and after the text you want influenced.
' * ' = *bold*
' // ' = /italic/
' _ ' = _underline_
' = =' = =code=
' ~ ~' = ~verbatim~
' + ' = +strike through+
